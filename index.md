# Cyber Deception Research Lab

The UNSW Sydney Cyber Deception Research Lab is a multidisciplinary research group investigating the construction, use and impact of deception. Themes include Machine Learning to create and detect deceptions, metrics and measurements of effectiveness, and perception and cognitive aspects.

Launched in early 2020 with support from the [Cyber Security CRC](https://www.cybersecuritycrc.org.au/) and [Penten](www.penten.com), our current focus is deceptive content creation. We have a number of projects that learn models of real world elements of the IT stack and generate realistic fakes, including documents, databases, audio and network traffic.
